<div id="intro">
  <p>It can often be confusing when learning the difference between Design Methodologies and Design Methods. Much of this comes from different points of view between different fields; art, design, engineering, science; as well as even differing opinions between institutions. Not all things are the same to all people.</p>
  <p>This guide outlines one designers point of view, with short guides and useful links when considering what kind methods or methodologies to choose when beginning a project.</p>
  <p>Methodologies are frameworks which you can follow through one/several steps or the entire design process. They generally have definitive stages which help you to follow a structured, practised procedure.</p>
  <p>Methods are the tools which we use within the stages of our chosen methodologies. Each method usually has a specific stage where they are commonly used, however they are also very versatile and can often be used throughout your design process to achieve different goals.</p>

  <p>The Stanford Design Method, sometimes referred to as Design Thinking, was created by IDEO and D.School at Stanford University. Itâ€™s a human-centred design methodology, focusing on the needs and wants. This methodology is highly versatile as it can easily be adapted to suit a wide range of design projects, as well as being suitable for use in hybrid methodologies.<br><br><br>For more information on this methodology, click here!</p>
